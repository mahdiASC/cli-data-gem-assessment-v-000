# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
    -I've created a working Ruby CLI for playing pokemon.
- [x] Pull data from an external source
    -The application properly pulls data from an external website using the 'open-uri' gem.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
    -The application uses a 'pokedex' to allow users to interact with a list of pokemon (both from a full list or by searching). The users select their pokemon and store them in a roster, from which they can battle an opponent.
